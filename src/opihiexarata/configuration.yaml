# observations.

# This is the maximum angular separation that two entries in the astrometric

# star/entry and thus correlated enough to be added to the intersection table.
# This value is in arcseconds.
PHOTOMETRY_MAXIMUM_INTERSECTION_SEPARATION : 5

# The star radius is used to define the photometric radius of a star for 
# zero-points; the unit is in arcseconds. A star's photometric profile is a 
# circle. (This is also used to define the mask for stars when calculating the
# total sky value.)
PHOTOMETRY_STAR_RADIUS_ARCSECOND : 1

# The science radius and the edge length mask the center and the edges of the 
# array respectively as they other wise contribute to a worse sky flux 
# correction value. Unlike the photometric radii, these are set by the 
# detector and so are pixel based and have units of pixels. (For faster 
# computational speed, the science mask is a box.)
