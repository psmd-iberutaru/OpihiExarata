class TargetSelectorWindow(QtWidgets.QWidget):
    """This is the general class for the target selector window. The whole
    purpose of this class is for the ease of finding an asteroid.

    The GUI attribute elements are too numerous to list.

    Attributes
    ----------
    current_filename : string
        The fits filename of the image which the position of the asteroid is
        going to be derived from.
    current_header : Header
        The fits header of the current fits image file.
    current_data : array
        The data of the of the current fits image file.
    reference_filename : string
        The fits filename of the image which is used to serve as an image to
        compare the current one to so that the asteroid is easier to find.
    reference_header : Header
        The fits header of the reference fits image file.
    reference_data : array
        The fits data of the reference fits image file.
    subtract_none : array
        The data after the comparison operation of doing nothing was applied.
        This serves mostly as a cache so that it only needs to be computed
        once.
    subtract_sidereal : array
        The data after the comparison operation of subtracting the two images.
        This serves mostly as a cache so that it only needs to be computed
        once.
    subtract_non_sidereal : array
        The data after the comparison operation of doing shifting then
        subtracting the two images. This serves mostly as a cache so that it
        only needs to be computed once. The non-sidereal rates of the
        current image are used.
    target_x : float
        The x pixel location of the asteroid in the current image.
    target_y : float
        The y pixel location of the asteroid in the current image.
    subtraction_method : string
        The method of subtraction (comparison) between the current image and
        the reference image.
    autoscale_1_99 : bool
        A flag to determine if, after every operation, the data's color bars
        should be scaled so that it is 1 - 99%, a helpful scaling.
    plotted_data : array
        The data as is plotted in the GUI.
    colorbar_scale_low : float
        The lower value for which the color bar determines as its 0, the lowest
        color value.
    colorbar_scale_high : float
        The higher value for which the color bar determines as its 1, the
        highest color value.
    opihi_figure : Figure
        The matplotlib figure class of the displayed image in the GUI.
    opihi_axes : Axes
        The matplotlib axes class of the displayed image in the GUI.
    opihi_canvas : FigureCanvasQTAgg
        The matplotlib canvas class of the displayed image in the GUI. This
        uses matplotlib's built-in Qt support.
    opihi_nav_toolbar : NavigationToolbar2QT
        The matplotlib navigation bar class of the displayed image in the
        GUI. This uses matplotlib's built-in Qt support.
    _opihi_coordinate_formatter : CoordinateFormatter
        A class to wrap around the imshow formatter for fancy printing.
