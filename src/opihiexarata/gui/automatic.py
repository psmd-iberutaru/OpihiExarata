        The filename of the fits file which is being worked on, or will be
        worked on.
    results_fits_filename : string
        The filename of the fits file which has already been solved. The
        results of which is posted.
    working_opihi_solution : OpihiSolution
        The OpihiSolution of the current working fits file. The results fits
        file solution, when determined to be solved, should be saved to disk
        automatically.
    results_opihi_solution : OpihiSolution
        The OpihiSolution of the current working fits file. The results fits
        file solution, when determined to be solved, should be saved to disk
        automatically.
    active_status : bool
        The flag which determines if the software is still considered in
        automatic mode and should be still solving images. If True, the process
        assumes that it is still active.
    operational_status_flag : string
        The status flag. This is similar to the active status, but this tracks
        for issues related to the operational state, not the loop itself.
        It primarily contains...

            - normal : Everything is working normally.
            - trigger : An image is being solved by a manual trigger command.
            - failed : An image failed to solve.
            - halted : The automatic mode stopped, but it was not done by the
            active status flag, but a file halt.
    zero_point_database : OpihiZeroPointDatabaseSolution
        If a zero point database is going to be constructed, as per the
        configuration file, this is the instance which manages the database.
