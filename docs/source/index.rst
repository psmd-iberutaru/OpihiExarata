OpihiExarata Documentation
==========================

OpihiExarata is a group of individual software packages, API services, and executables 
designed to process data from the IRTF Opihi telescope. It serves to be an astrometric 
solver, photometric calibrator, asteroid finder, ephemeris computer, and astrometric 
monitor. We accomplish this by integrating services and open source software collections
for our purposes.

This software is specific to the IRTF Opihi telescope.


Etymology of OpihiExarata
`````````````````````````
The IRTF Opihi telescope is named after the `opihi`_, a limpet which lives on rocky shores by sticking to the rocks. In a similar vein, the Opihi telescope sticks hard onto the side of the main IRTF telescope. One of the three opihi species endemic to the Hawaii islands is the `Hawaiian blackfoot opihi`_. The Opihi telescope is similar to this species and for this reason, this software is named after it. (The similarities: the opihi species and the telescope are both black; the Opihi telescope is rather small compared to the IRTF, the blackfoot is a small opihi; and the blackfoot opihi is a high delicacy, similar to this software, it has a rather small audience.)

The binomial taxonomical name of the Hawaiian blackfoot opihi is Cellana exarata. The genus Cellana describes the group of limpets including the opihi, but "exarata" is the identifying part for the Hawaiian blackfoot, thus the name of this software, we decided, is a hybrid: OpihiExarata. A backronym for it, which describes its function: Ephemeris with eXtra Atmospheric Response and Asteroid Trajectory Analysis.
