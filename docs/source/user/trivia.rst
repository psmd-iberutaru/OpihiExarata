Etymology of OpihiExarata
=========================

The IRTF Opihi telescope is named after the `opihi`_, a limpet which lives on 
rocky shores by sticking to the rocks. In a similar vein, the Opihi telescope 
sticks hard onto the side of the main IRTF telescope. One of the three opihi 
species endemic to the Hawaii islands is the `Hawaiian blackfoot opihi`_. The 
Opihi telescope is similar to this species and for this reason, this software 
is named after it. (The similarities: the opihi species and the telescope are 
both black; the Opihi telescope is rather small compared to the IRTF, the 
blackfoot is a small opihi; and the blackfoot opihi is a high delicacy, 
similar to this software, it has a rather small audience.)

The binomial taxonomical name of the Hawaiian blackfoot opihi is Cellana 
exarata. The genus Cellana describes the group of limpets including the opihi, 
but *exarata* is the identifying part for the Hawaiian blackfoot, thus the 
name of this software, we decided, is the hybrid: OpihiExarata. A backronym for 
it, descriptive of its function: OPIHI Ephemeris with eXtra Atmospheric 
Response and Asteroid Trajectory Analysis.
