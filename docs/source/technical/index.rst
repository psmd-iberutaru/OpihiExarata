Technical Manual
================

The technical manual here is made for the those looking for more detail about 
the inner-workings of the OpihiExarata software. This is typically staff and 
maintainers for the OpihiExarata package, but it may be useful for some other 
audiences.

We detail the installation instructions (written primarily for the computer 
which runs the Opihi telescope in the event that this software needs to be 
reinstalled).

We also detail some of the architectural considerations and designs of the 
OpihiExarata software as a whole and some of the algorithms and conventions 
which underpin the implementation.

The license by which this software is licensed under, and a small discussion 
on the licenses of its dependencies is also provided.
