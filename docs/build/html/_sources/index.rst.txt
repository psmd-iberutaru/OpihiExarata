==========================
OpihiExarata Documentation
==========================

OpihiExarata is a group of individual software packages, API services, and executables 
designed to process data from the IRTF Opihi telescope. It serves to be an astrometric 
solver, photometric calibrator, asteroid finder, ephemeris computer, and astrometric 
monitor. We accomplish this by integrating services and open source software collections
for our purposes.

This software is specific to the IRTF Opihi telescope.

`Code coverage`_ is available in html. The code manual (and overall documentation 
is generated via Sphinx), and the code coverage is generated by a different 
tool. As such, it is manually linked rather than integrated.
