Here we detail the methods behind a few of the algorithms that we have 
implemented ourselves. The algorithms and implementations of other systems 
(especially the engines and services of 
:ref:`technical-architecture-services-engines`) are outside the scope of this 
documentation. See :ref:`user-citations` for further references on algorithms 
implemented by others that we use. 

We detail the algorithms here so that its methods (and some particularities) 
are documented and some of the choice made are not lost in future development 
and upkeep of this software.

See the sidebar (for the web version of this documentation) for the details on 
specific algorithms.
