Zero Point Monitoring
=====================

One of the functionalities of the Opihi telescope is to record and monitor 
the atmospheric conditions over time. This functionality is similar to the 
`CFHT SkyProbe <https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Elixir/skyprobe/home.html>`_.

We record the filter zero point magnitudes of images taken by Opihi over time. 
(We store the data in a database, see :ref:`technical-architecture-monitor-database`.)
Similar to the CFHT SkyProbe, we also present the zero points measured 
throughout the night on a monitoring webpage of sorts.

The webpage can be accessed here: `Monitoring Webpage <http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~opihi/monitor/>`_
