    An image of the Opihi telescope during the commissioning process. An
    aluminum weather proof shield has been since been added which covers the 
    back half of the system to cover the electronics.

We detail the physical specifications of the Opihi telescope itself. As the 
:ref:`technical-index` is more for detail about the software, and the 
actual telescope's physical quantities may be useful for users, we leave this 
section here in the user manual.

See :numref:`figure-opihi-telescope-no-shield` for an image of the Opihi 
telescope itself.

The Opihi telescope:

- Is a 0.43 meter corrected Dall-Kirkham telescope from PlaneWave Instruments.
- It has a field of view of 32 arcminuites across.
- The sensitivity is approximately 20 magnitudes in a one minute exposure.
- Has a pixel scale of 0.94 arcseconds per pixel.
- The filter wheel contains four SDSS filters (g', r', i', z'), a clear position, and three (currently unused) slots for other filters.

The camera/detector on the Opihi telescope:

- Is a 2k x 2k Andor iKon-L 936 CCD Camera.
- The operating temperature is -50 Celsius (223.15 K).
- The dark current is about 1 electron/s.
- The read noise is about 10.3 electron/s.
- The well depth is about 150 000 electrons.
